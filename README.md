# store
basic store app in angular

1. No backend is used
2. All service calls are handled in the service layer itself by using
raw data in service objects.
3. cosmetic look and feel have been kept simple.
4. used some generator to finish the task, so have not gone crazy on
latest & greatest app structure, es6, utilities like underscore.
5. please share your valuable feedback and lets have a chat about all
the decisions taken while building the app.
